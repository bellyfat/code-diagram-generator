{diagram_category}: {diagram_option}

{description}
```
Your task is to create a {diagram_option} Diagram using mermaid js markdown. You will be given a code outline and a folder structure to base your design on.

## Deliverables

- The final product needs to be well written mermaid code that can be parsed with mermaid CLI.  strings should be properly escaped, this is going to be passed into a unit test for machine evaluation. syntax errors will be considered a failure.  avoid invalid control, escape characters and other lexical errors.

- It should be a beautiful diagram. Make sure it shows all concepts of the diagram category and the code context.

- Remember the function takes plain text input. Should not contain encodings like \n, \t, etc.  Function parameters should be trimmed/stripped appropriately.  Consider your diagram carefully to come up with the right visuals.

Here are some simple examples, we want something more advanced and much more thoughtful:

### 1. Flowchart for User Authentication

```mermaid
graph TD;
  Start[Start] --> Login[Login Page];
  Login -->|Invalid Credentials| Error[Show Error];
  Login -->|Valid Credentials| Dashboard[Dashboard];
  Error --> Login;
  Dashboard -->|Logout| Start;
```

**Explanation**: This flowchart shows a basic user authentication process. The user starts at the "Login Page," and upon entering valid credentials, navigates to the "Dashboard." If the credentials are invalid, an error is shown, and the user is redirected back to the "Login Page."

### 2. Sequence Diagram for API Request-Response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Client
  participant API
  User->>Client: Initiate Request
  Client->>API: Send HTTP Request
  API->>Client: Send HTTP Response
  Client->>User: Display Data
```

**Explanation**: This sequence diagram illustrates a typical API request-response cycle. The user initiates a request through the client, which sends an HTTP request to the API. The API then responds, and the client displays the data to the user.

### 3. Class Diagram for Object-Oriented Design

```mermaid
classDiagram
  ClassA --> ClassB : Inheritance
  ClassA : +Method1()
  ClassA : +Method2()
  ClassB : +Method3()
```

**Explanation**: In this class diagram, `ClassA` and `ClassB` are involved in an inheritance relationship. `ClassA` has methods `Method1()` and `Method2()`, while `ClassB`, which inherits from `ClassA`, introduces a new method `Method3()`.

### 4. Gantt Chart for Project Management

```mermaid
gantt
  title A Simple Gantt Chart
  section Design
  Task1           :done,    des1, 2023-08-01,2023-08-05
  Task2           :active,  des2, 2023-08-06, 3d
  section Development
  Task3           :         dev1, 2023-08-10, 5d
```

**Explanation**: This Gantt chart outlines a project's timeline divided into "Design" and "Development" sections. It shows completed, active, and upcoming tasks along with their duration and start dates.

### 5. State Diagram for Order Management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> New
  New --> Processing : Place Order
  Processing --> Shipped : Ship Order
  Shipped --> Delivered : Deliver Order
  Delivered --> [*]
```

**Explanation**: This state diagram represents an order management process, starting from a "New" state. After placing an order, it moves to "Processing," then to "Shipped," and finally to "Delivered," concluding the order process.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step to make sure you have the right answer.

I want you to use this application as the context for your diagram:
