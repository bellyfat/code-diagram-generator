{diagram_category}: {diagram_option}

```
Your task is to create a {diagram_option} Diagram using mermaid js markdown. You will be given a code outline and a folder structure to base your design on.

## Deliverables

- The final product needs to be well written mermaid code that can be parsed with mermaid CLI.  Extremely important that strings are properly escaped, references aren't made to things that don't exist and everything is machine readable- this is going to be passed into a unit test for evaluation.  Syntax errors will be considered a failure.  Absolutely no invalid control characters.

- It should be a beautiful diagram.  Demonstrate your ability.  Make sure it shows all concepts of the diagram category and the code context.

- Remember the function takes plain text input. Should not contain encodings like \n, \t, etc.  Function parameters should be trimmed/stripped appropriately.  Consider your diagram carefully to come up with the right visuals.
