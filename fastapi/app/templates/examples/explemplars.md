### 1. Flowchart for User Authentication

```mermaid
graph TD;
  Start[Start] --> Login[Login Page];
  Login -->|Invalid Credentials| Error[Show Error];
  Login -->|Valid Credentials| Dashboard[Dashboard];
  Error --> Login;
  Dashboard -->|Logout| Start;
```

**Explanation**: This flowchart shows a basic user authentication process. The user starts at the "Login Page," and upon entering valid credentials, navigates to the "Dashboard." If the credentials are invalid, an error is shown, and the user is redirected back to the "Login Page."

### 2. Sequence Diagram for API Request-Response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Client
  participant API
  User->>Client: Initiate Request
  Client->>API: Send HTTP Request
  API->>Client: Send HTTP Response
  Client->>User: Display Data
```

**Explanation**: This sequence diagram illustrates a typical API request-response cycle. The user initiates a request through the client, which sends an HTTP request to the API. The API then responds, and the client displays the data to the user.

### 3. Class Diagram for Object-Oriented Design

```mermaid
classDiagram
  ClassA --> ClassB : Inheritance
  ClassA : +Method1()
  ClassA : +Method2()
  ClassB : +Method3()
```

**Explanation**: In this class diagram, `ClassA` and `ClassB` are involved in an inheritance relationship. `ClassA` has methods `Method1()` and `Method2()`, while `ClassB`, which inherits from `ClassA`, introduces a new method `Method3()`.

```

**Explanation**: This Gantt chart outlines a project's timeline divided into "Design" and "Development" sections. It shows completed, active, and upcoming tasks along with their duration and start dates.
